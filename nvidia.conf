# Make a soft dependency for nvidia-uvm as adding the module loading to
# /usr/lib/modules-load.d/nvidia-uvm.conf for systemd consumption, makes the
# configuration file to be added to the initrd but not the module, throwing an
# error on plymouth about not being able to find the module.
# Ref: /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/00systemd/module-setup.sh

# Even adding the module is not the correct thing, as we don't want it to be
# included in the initrd, so use this configuration file to specify the
# dependency.

# Enable complete power management.

# Uncomment the following line to enable kernel modesetting support.
# There is NO graphical framebuffer (like OSS drivers) at the moment; this is
# only for Wayland. For Gnome, you also require an EGLStream build of Mutter.
# Fedora disables Wayland with udev rules in GDM if detecting the driver, so
# the relevant udev rule must be modified: /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules

# options nvidia-drm modeset=1

# Preserve all video memory allocations when enabling suspend.
# This also requires enabling the following services in nvidia-driver:
# systemctl enable nvidia-suspend nvidia-hibernate nvidia-resume

# options nvidia NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1
